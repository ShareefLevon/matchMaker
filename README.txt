This survey takes questions from a JSON file called 'surveyQuestions.json'. If you wish to add more questions,
 simply add another question to the array in the JSON file. Dependencies are in the package.json. 

-render vertical/horizontal view works, but will kinda mess up questions. Works perfect with no render switches.

Once you complete the survey, if you select match it will show you your matches!
